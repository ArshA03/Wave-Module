# Overview

## Introduction

Wave Module is written in python 3.8, so any same version or above could be used. If there was an error while using the module, it is recommended to download Python 3.8 from [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads).  

There are examples provided so the user would find it easier to use the module for the first time. The Dataset, which is used as an example, is a bearing vibration data gathered by [IMS Center](http://www.imscenter.net/) and is downloadable from [here](https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/c/3/).  

>*Since the Dataset manual has stated the potential problems and reasons behind the failures, it is best used to validate the Dataset or the functions of the module itself.*

Basic knowledge of python is needed to comprehend the code, although it would be understood better with a specialist's help.

## Prerequisites

The module is built on some well-known python packages. However, each of these packages is strong enough to perform such tasks, although this module's purpose is to grasp a basic knowledge of practical coding.

You can see the required packages below:

- NumPy
- scipy
- matplotlib
- pandas

  These packages could be easily installed with `pip` module, which could be used after installing python. If you are not familiar with `pip`, just paste the following code in your command line:

```python
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scipy
```
